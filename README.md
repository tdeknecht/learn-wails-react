# Learn Wails
Following along with some of the introduction and tutorial information found [here](https://wails.io/docs/howdoesitwork). Expanding on the provided [Dogs API](https://wails.io/docs/tutorials/dogsapi).

The purpose of this project is to only become familiar with Wails.

## Command QuickRef

* `wails dev` Live development
* `wails build -platform windows` Build _.exe_ for Windows

## Observations

* Developing on WSL2. The GUI can be slow, and sometimes hang. Have had to `wsl --shutdown` to get things back in order.
* When building the binary and running it, can take a few seconds to run. Once it's up, it seems to perform well enough.
